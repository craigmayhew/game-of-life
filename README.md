### 2022 Update
This project is a unique take on the game of life that gave me an excuse to try some 3D rust programming back in 2019 and 2020 using [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst). Recently rewritten in [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). Game mechanics are in and mostly working as of version 0.8.
