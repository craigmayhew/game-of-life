# Game of Life
A unique take on the game of life

### 2022 Update
This project is a unique take on the game of life that gave me an excuse to try some 3D rust programming back in 2019 and 2020. Although it has released versions, we still don't have the game mechanics.

It's time to pick this back up again as I find a few hours here and there. Who knows, maybe I'll finally complete it!
