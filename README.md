### 2022 Update
This project is a unique take on the game of life that gave me an excuse to try some 3D rust programming back in 2019 and 2020. Although it has released versions, we still don't have the game mechanics. Originally thiis project used the Amethyst game engine, but as this is discontinued it's now moving to bevy,
